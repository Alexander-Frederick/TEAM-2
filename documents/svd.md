2. INVENTORY OF MATERIALS

2.1 Documents Released
//README and SVD

2.2 Executable Media Released
<Describe any executable files that are included with this software system>

2.3 Software Projects\Assemblies Released
<Identify and describe the current projects and assemblies included in your system. You do not
need to include any ubiquitous assemblies used by the .Net framework or Java.>

2.4 Test Projects\Scripts Released
<Identify and describe the test projects and scripts available for this version. Include information
about any mocked items that may have been needed for testing.>

3. COMPLETED WORK

3.1 Feature 1
<Don’t really say “Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few words.>

3.1.1 Description
<Provide a short description of the completed feature.>

3.1.2 Completed Functionality
<Enumerate the completed functionality associated with this feature. These must be clear
and well-written statements of the functionality>

3.1.3 Related Unit Test Cases
<This should be a table of all unit test cases. It should have the name of the test case, the
number of the functionality it tests from the above enumeration, and a color coded
highlighting to indicate pass or failure. For the color coded highlighting, use green to
indicate that a test passed, red to indicate that a test failed, and yellow to indicate
that a test was not ran. Include the percentage of tests that were ran, the percentage
of tests that succeeded, and the percentage of tests that failed.>

3.1.4 Related Acceptance Tests
<User acceptance tests should be written in the Gherkin format and should indicate specific
test cases that were tested against the system.>

4. CURRENT DESIGN

4.1 Description and Evaluation of Current Architecture
<Explain the decisions made for the current architecture of the system. Evaluate the current
architecture of the system against the principles that have been discussed up to the current point in
the course. Defend the decisions that were made for your architecture. It is recommended to use
specific examples from your software system to support your claims.>

4.2 Major Software Interfaces
<Describe the major interfaces included in the software system that facilitate communication
between the layers and explain each interface’s adherence to SOLID principles..>

4.3 Evaluation of Classes
<For each class in your system, give a UML diagram that shows the class name, members, and
methods of the class. You should give a description of the responsibilities of the class and explain
its adherence to SOLID principles.>

4.4 Current Software Components
<Describe and diagram the logical components of the current version of the software system. Your
diagram should include the logical relationships between components. A UML package diagram
may be appropriate for this purpose. You should also include a table that describes the
responsibilities of each component.>

4.5 Current Software Layers
<Describe and discuss the logical layers of the current version of the software system along with
what components and classes comprise it. Also provide indicators for what layers can
communicate with each other. A UML package diagram may be appropriate for this purpose. You
should also include a table that describes the responsibilities of each layer.>

4.6 Incorporating Design Patterns
<Describe the current design patterns that are being used within your software system and why
they are relevant to the system.>

4.7 Data Schema
<Describe the schema used for persistent storage. This may be a database schema or file
structure used for permanent storage. >

4.8 Violations to Design Principles
<Describe any known violations to the design principles discussed in this class and why they were
necessary.>

5. REMAINING WORK

5.1 Remaining Software Features
<Any software features that are remaining to be implemented>

5.2 Known Issues and Bugs
<Any known issues with the current software system. If your team decides to use an issue tracking
system, please include information for viewing the system.>

Appendix A: Glossary
<Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SVD, including acronyms and
abbreviations.>

Appendix B: GitHub Information
<Name of your group’s GitHub Repository and a list of features that are currently being used. For
example, issue tracking system, wiki, etc.>
